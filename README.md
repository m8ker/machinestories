MACHINE STORIES
===============

Machine Stories is a simple creativity tool built with JavaScript. It pulls data from some arrays defined in /js/data.js. It uses a jQuery ajax-based infinite scrolling technique lifted from here: [Infinite Scrolling Demo 2](http://www.jquery4u.com/tutorials/jquery-infinite-scrolling-demos/) to generate an endless list of story ideas.
